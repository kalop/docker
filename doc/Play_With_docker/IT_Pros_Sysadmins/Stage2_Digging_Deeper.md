#### 1. Security
#### 1.1.Seccomp profiles
https://training.play-with-docker.com/security-seccomp/
 Seccomp is a sandboxing in Linux kernel that acts like a firewall for system calls. It uses Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) rules to filter syscalls and control how they are handled. These filters can significantly limit a containers access to the Docker Hostâ€™s Linux kernel - especially for simple containers/applications.
